        "Q.1 What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        " - Ans. In Python, a function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task and is defined using the def keyword. Functions can exist independently and be called by their name directly, like def greet():. On the other hand, a method is a function that is associated with an object or class—it is defined inside a class and called on an instance of that class. Methods always take at least one argument, usually self, which refers to the instance calling the method. For example, in a class Car, you might define a method like def start_engine(self):, and it would be called using my_car.start_engine(). So, while all methods are functions, not all functions are methods. The main difference lies in their association with objects—functions are standalone, whereas methods are bound to objects or classes."

        "- Ans. In Python, parameters are the names used when defining a function to accept input values, while arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it is called. For example, in the function definition def greet(name):, name is a parameter. When you call greet(\"Shivam\"), the value \"Shivam\" is the argument. Python allows different types of arguments, such as positional arguments, keyword arguments, default parameters, and arbitrary arguments using *args and **kwargs. Parameters help make functions flexible and reusable by allowing input customization, and arguments provide the real data for the function to work with during execution. This distinction is key to understanding how functions operate and communicate in Python."

        "Q.3 What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "- Ans. In Python, functions can be defined using the def keyword followed by the function name and parentheses, which may include parameters. For example, def greet(): defines a simple function without parameters, while def add(a, b): defines a function with two parameters. Another way to define functions is using lambda functions, which are anonymous functions written in a single line using the lambda keyword, like lambda x: x * 2. Functions can be called by writing their name followed by parentheses, such as greet() or add(5, 3). You can call functions using positional arguments, where values are passed in order, or keyword arguments, where values are passed with parameter names like add(a=5, b=3). You can also call functions using default arguments, where some parameters have predefined values, or use * args and ** kwargs to pass a variable number of arguments. These flexible ways of defining and calling functions make Python powerful and easy to use."

        "- Ans. The return statement in a Python function is used to send a result or value back to the place where the function was called. It ends the function’s execution and optionally provides a value to the caller. For example, in def add(a, b): return a + b, the function returns the sum of a and b. Without a return statement, the function returns None by default. The returned value can be stored in a variable, used in expressions, or passed to other functions. The return statement is essential when you want your function to produce an output that can be used further in your program."

        "Q.5 What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "- Ans. In Python, an iterator is an object that represents a stream of data and returns elements one at a time using the next() function. It keeps track of its current position and knows how to fetch the next value until the sequence is exhausted. Iterators implement two methods: __iter__() and __next__(). On the other hand, an iterable is any object that can return an iterator using the __iter__() method. Examples of iterables include lists, tuples, strings, and dictionaries. The main difference is that iterables are containers that can be looped over (like in a for loop), while iterators are the tools that do the actual iteration. When you pass an iterable to the iter() function, it returns an iterator that can then be used to access elements one by one using next()."

        "Q.6  Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined?\n",
        "- Ans. In Python, generators are a special type of iterator that allow you to iterate over data without storing the entire sequence in memory. They are defined using a function with the yield keyword instead of return. When a generator function is called, it doesn’t run the code immediately but returns a generator object. Each time next() is called on this object, the function resumes from where it left off and continues until it hits the next yield. This makes generators memory-efficient and ideal for working with large datasets or infinite sequences. For example, def count_up(): yield 1; yield 2; yield 3 defines a simple generator. Generators automatically implement the iterator protocol, so they can be used in loops and other iteration contexts just like regular iterators."

        "Q.7 What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "- Ans. Generators offer several advantages over regular functions, especially when dealing with large datasets or streaming data. The key benefit is memory efficiency, as generators yield one item at a time instead of storing the entire result in memory like regular functions with lists. This is ideal for processing large files or data streams. Another advantage is lazy evaluation, meaning values are generated only when needed, which improves performance and reduces unnecessary computation. Generators also help write cleaner and more readable code for complex iterations, especially in loops. Additionally, they maintain state between iterations without needing to manage loop variables manually. Overall, generators provide a powerful, lightweight, and Pythonic way to handle data iteration efficiently.\n",

        "Q.8 What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "- Ans. A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword instead of def. It can take any number of arguments but only has a single expression, which is automatically returned. The basic syntax is lambda arguments: expression. For example, lambda x: x * 2 is a lambda function that doubles the input. Lambda functions are typically used when a short function is needed for a short period, especially as arguments to higher-order functions like map(), filter(), and sorted(). They are useful for writing concise and readable code when the function’s logic is simple and doesn’t require a full def block."

        "- Ans. The map() function in Python is used to apply a given function to each item in an iterable (like a list, tuple, etc.) and return a new map object (which is an iterator) containing the results. The basic syntax is map(function, iterable). For example, if you want to double each number in a list, you can use map(lambda x: x * 2, [1, 2, 3]), which returns an iterator with values [2, 4, 6]. You can convert the result to a list using list() for viewing or further use. The main purpose of map() is to simplify the code when you need to apply the same operation to every element of a sequence, making it more efficient and readable compared to a for loop."
